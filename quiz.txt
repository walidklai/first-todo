5: DOM stands for Document Object Model

6: JSON stands fir JavaScript Object Notation

7: NPM stands for Node Package Manager (another alternative is yarn)

8: - UI Rendering & performance
   - Cost-effective
   - Open source
   - Eeasy to switch between client & server
   - Component based (Reusable pieces of UI)
   => Excellement for real-time / Data-intensive apps

9: No. MongoDB doesn't support primary key-foreign key relationship.
